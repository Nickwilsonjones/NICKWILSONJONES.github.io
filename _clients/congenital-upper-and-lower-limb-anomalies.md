If your child has had surgery to correct differences to upper and lower limbs that they were born with **in the last 4-6 weeks**&nbsp;and there is a problem with **wound breakdown** or **redness**, then please contact my secretary using the details listed in the contact us section and we will arrange an appropriate online or telephone review. We can always send prescriptions for antibiotics or dressings as required.

If your child or yourself has had surgery to a congenital limb anomaly and are in long-term follow up, then please contact my secretary if there are acute issues or concerns that are affecting you on a daily basis. If these concerns require it, then I will arrange an acute telephone or online consultation.

If you or your child is awaiting an appointment or surgery, sadly things will be significantly delayed.

Please contact us if there are acute, persistent problems affecting you or your child on a daily basis.
