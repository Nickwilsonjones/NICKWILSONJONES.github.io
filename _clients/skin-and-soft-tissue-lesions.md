### Complications

If you have had surgery recently and there is **redness** or **wound breakdown**, please take a photograph of the area and we will arrange a safe way for it to be reviewed. We will then arrange either an online or telephone consultation. We can always provide a prescription for dressings and antibiotics if required.&nbsp;

If you child is **unwell** with a **high temperature** please **attend your accident and emergency department.**

If your child has had an operation for a skin lesion in the last few months, please rest assured that we will be accessing the **histology** (microscope analysis) of the lesion and either write or telephone you with the results. We rarely use stitches that require removal in children, so once the dressing has fallen off, please just bath or shower the wound as you would normally.

### Post-operative care

**Moisturise&nbsp;**with Vaseline or E45 and **massage** firmly, as this will help promote healthy scarring. Please keep the **pink scars** protected from the sun with a high factor **sun block for the first year.**

Six weeks to three months following the operation, the scar may look slightly **raised**, **red and itchy** and this is normally a transient phase and will continue to settle with moisturisation and massage but scars can take 18 months to reach full maturity (best cosmetic result). If the red itchy, lumpy phase continues or is problematic, then please contact my secretary using the details listed in the contact us section of this page and we can arrange a telephone or online consultation.&nbsp;

### Follow up

If yourself or your child has had an operation for a skin or soft tissue malignancy, then you will have a formal online or telephone consultation but this may not be on the specific day that it has already been booked. Please contact my secretary and we can discuss the appropriate method of review.&nbsp;

If you or your child is awaiting an appointment or surgery, sadly things will be significantly delayed.

Please contact us if there are **acute**, **persistent** problems affecting you or your child on a daily basis.
