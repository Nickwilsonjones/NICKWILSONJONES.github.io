### Early complications

If your son has had hypospadias surgery within the last month and is troubled either with **redness** or **wound breakdown**, or if you feel he has d**ifficulty in passing urine**, then please take a photograph of the required area and contact my secretary on the telephone number listed in the contact us section of this page.&nbsp;

We will find a safe way for the images to be looked at and I will contact you either via telephone or email to advise.&nbsp;

If I feel it is necessary, the appropriate dressings and prescriptions can be sent through the post and we can hopefully follow your sonâ€™s progress healing with regular photography.

### Stenosis

If your son is under regular follow up that is normally either annually or bi-annually, then we would want to hear from you if there are signs that he is developing a possible **stenosis** (narrowing of the reconstructed urethra) or a fistula (second opening or leak from the newly reconstructed urethra).&nbsp;

Signs that there may be a potential stenosis or narrowing of the tube would be that your son is having **recurrent urinary tract infections** (UTI) or complaining of **urgency** (sudden desire to pass urine despite having been recently), or the **narrowing and thinning of the stream** and **incomplete opening of the bladder**.&nbsp;

If your son experiences these symptoms over a protracted period of weeks, please contact my secretary via telephone and we can arrange a telephone or online consultation.&nbsp;

If your son develops **two streams or a leak**, please be reassured that as long as he is emptying his bladder, all is well. A very small number of these may heal on their own but most require surgical correction at a later date, but **this is not an emergency**. Please do however contact us via my secretary and we can arrange a telephone or on-line consultation.

### Outpatient Follow up

In all other boys that are having standard outpatient follow up with respect to their hypospadias, with a delay as mentioned above, it is safe and appropriate when considering that some surgeons and hypospadias do not continue with long term follow up of any form. If there are any worries or concerns, please do not hesitate in contacting my secretary and we can try and arrange a telephone or on-line review.&nbsp;

If you or your child is awaiting an appointment or surgery, sadly things will be significantly delayed.

Please contact us if there are acute, persistent problems affecting you or your child on a daily basis.
