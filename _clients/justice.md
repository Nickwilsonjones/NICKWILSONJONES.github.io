Please be aware that the field of vascular anomalies covers a **huge range of different pathologies.** Below is some basic advice with respect to the most common.

If you or your child is awaiting an appointment or surgery, sadly things will be significantly delayed.

Please <u><strong>contact us if there are acute, persistent problems </strong></u>affecting you or your child on a daily basis.

### Infantile Haemangioma

For those parents who have children with infantile haemangioma (strawberry naevus or strawberry birth mark), the vast majority, as would have been explained to you in the outpatient setting, **will involute (disappear) over the first few years of life** but with only 50% involuted by the age of 5, 70% by the age of 7 and 90% by the age of 9. &nbsp;

If your child has a complicated haemangioma, we may have started, in combination with our paediatric colleagues, using the drug ***Propranolol***. Propranolol should be continued and the dose increased as your child grows.&nbsp;

If your child is on Propranolol at present then we can, together with our paediatric colleagues, organise incremental increases in the dosage as long as we have an accurate weight for the child. This can be done via telephone or on-line consultation.

You would already have been given advice concerning the issues to watch out for when your child is on Propranolol and **if there are any significant issues then please contact the doctor who is providing the Propranolol therapy** or myself via my secretary and we can arrange the appropriate review. If you have any serious complications, please do not hesitate in contacting your local emergency department.&nbsp;

### Venous Malformations

A significant number of patients have venous malformations which are under longer term review. A number of you will be under joint review by myself and the lymphoedema team and may well have **pressure garments**, which should be worn as you have directed.&nbsp;

Occasionally, within venous malformations, small painful areas can develop. As soon as this occurs, simple **analgesia** will reduce the inflammatory process and reduce the level of discomfort which normally settles within 5-7 days.&nbsp;

If there is prolonged pain or discomfort, or you feel the limb is significantly swollen, then please **contact us immediately** when we can arrange either an online review, via telephone or if absolutely necessary face to face.&nbsp;

### Lymphatic Malformations

If you or your child is suffering from lymphatic malformation, you may be under the joint care of myself and the lymphoedema team with **pressure garments**. You should continue to use those as prescribed.&nbsp;

If you experience **small bleeds** into the **tiny vesicles** in the skin, these are normally self-limiting. You should use conservative measures with a non-stick dressing and contact us if they continue.&nbsp;

Patients with lymphatic malformations are l**ess resistant to localised bacterial infections of the skin,** therefore if you experience any **spreading redness** within or round your lesion, then you might be experiencing a **localised infection**. Please take a photograph and we can provide a safe way to review the images and potentially post you a prescription or offer advice without the need for a face to face review.

If you are unwell with redness and a high fever please urgently c**ontact your local accident and emergency department.&nbsp;**

### Arteriovenous Malformations

If you or your child is being treated for a true arteriovenous malformation, then hopefully you will be following the advice that we have provided in clinic.&nbsp;

If you have an acute episodes of **bleeding**, direct pressure for three minutes initially and then review. If still bleeding, repeat for a further three minutes. If the bleeding continues, you will need to **attend your local accident and emergency department.**

If your lesion is **growing rapidly** and giving you cause for concern or if you have recently become **pregnant** please contact my secretary and we can arrange an online or telephone review.&nbsp;
